    <u><h2> Problems within the Amazon</h2></u>
     
    <p> The Amazon rainforest is being effected every single day by the amount of trees being cut down and during <br> 
        this process many diffrent animals and native people to that land are being forced to change environments<br>
        We having provided many solutions being Donations, Recycling, Re-planting trees and Spreading the word<br>
        This threat on the Amazon Rainforest has impacted the species which inhabit the rainforest as well as the<br>
        indigenous people whom live on the lands of the rainforest. The rainforest is at a huge risk of many species<br>
        becoming extinct and resulting in many of there habitats to be destroyed and lack of food source results in<br>
        a overall decrease in there population. But the indigenous people are also getting affected with there food<br>
        source and there population will be hit with a major decrease. The indigenous people are very important as <br>
        they are an important role when it comes to south americas fruit and vegetables as the indigenous people<br>
        create farms in the amazon rainforest for crops such as Bananas, Coconuts and Pineapples just to name a few.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
       There is a estimate of 400 tribes which live in the Amazon Rainforest with diffrent cultures, Language and<br>
       diffrent religions and beliefs. Due to illegal mining done within the Amazon Rainforest it is destroying the<br>
       land and environment which there way of maintaining a food source as well as the mecury found in the mines<br>
       from the people mining all the gold it is poisoning the indigenous peoples water source. People use fire to clear<br>
       out the land for farming and grazing but by doing this they are effecting the animals and there habitats by<br>
       destroying them. Over 10,000 species in the Amazon Rainforest are at a risk of extinction due to deforestation<br> 
       examples being Capybara, Blue Macaw and South American Tapir. Most of these animals are at a risk due to no habitat.<br>
